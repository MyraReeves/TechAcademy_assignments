// Strings are one of the seven value types. In JavaScript, we can create strings with double quotes (“) or single quotes (‘), such as: “Mary had a little lamb,” or ‘Its fleece was white as snow.’  It doesn’t matter whether you use double or single quotes; they both perform the same functions.

// In the following code, “Hello, World!” is a string.

alert("Hello, World!");

// The alert() method causes a box to display with text on it – it includes an “OK” button.
