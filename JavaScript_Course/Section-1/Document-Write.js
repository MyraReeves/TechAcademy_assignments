// Another way to display text using JavaScript is the document.write() method:

document.write('Hello, world!');

// A common action performed in coding is to assign variables.  Variables are key in every programming language.  To put the definition simply, it's a value that can be altered, depending on codnitions or data passed to the program.

// In mathematics, an operator is a symbol used to carry out a computation. There are several different kinds of operators. Arithmetic operators such as +, -, /, *, and % are used to perform math functions.”

// Operators such as >=, ==, and != are used to compare values. Logical operators like “and,” “or,” and “not” are used to evaluate whether an expression is true or false. In JavaScript, the assignment operator is “=”; it is used to assign a value to a variable.

// For example, to say that X = 10 in JavaScript, we are assigning the variable “X” the value “10.”

// To assign a variable in JavaScript we write:

var X = "Hello, world!";

// We assigned variable X to string value “Hello, world!”

// If we then wanted to display the string “Hello, world!” using our variable we would write:

document.write(X);




// Example #2:

var A = 'This is a string';
document.write(A);
