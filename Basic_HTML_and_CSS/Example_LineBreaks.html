    <!-- This poem was the example given in the curriculum for using line breaks. -->

    <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, <br>
        And sorry I could not travel both, <br>
        And be one traveler, long I stood, <br>
        And looked down one as far as I could, <br>
        To where it bent in the undergrowth; <br>
    </p>

    <p>Then took the other, as just as fair, <br>
        And having perhaps the better claim, <br>
        Because it was grassy and wanted wear; <br>
        Though as for that the passing there, <br>
        Had worn them really about the same; <br>
    </p>
