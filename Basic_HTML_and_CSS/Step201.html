    <h1>The Raven 🐦‍⬛</h1>
    <h2>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Edgar Allan Poe</h2>
    <p span style="color: #808080;">
        Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, <br>
        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore— <br>
        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, <br>
        As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. <br>
        “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door— <br>
        Only this and nothing more.” <br>
    </p>

    <p span style="color: #708090;">
        Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; <br>
        And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. <br>
        Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow <br>
        From my books surcease of sorrow — sorrow for the lost Lenore — <br>
        For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore — <br>
        Nameless <strong>here</strong> for evermore. <br>
    </p>
    
    <p span style="color: #808080;">
        And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each <span style="color:purple;">purple</span> curtain <br>
        Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; <br>
        So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating <br>
        “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door— <br>
        Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;— <br>
        This it is and nothing more.” <br>
    </p>

    <p span style="color: #708090;">
        Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, <br>
        “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; <br>
        But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, <br>
        And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, <br>
        That I scarce was sure I heard you” — Here I opened wide the door; <br>
        ...Darkness there and nothing more.
