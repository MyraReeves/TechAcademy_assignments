			<h3>Stickers on the outer cover</h3>
			<p>There are 2 stickers on the outside lid of my laptop.  One is in the center and is of a girl reading books.  The other is of Captain Flint hugging a stuffed walrus with hearts floating upward from him.  Awwwww!</p>
			<p>Speaking of Captain Flint, here is his famous quote...</p>
			
			<blockquote cite="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5174426/characters/nm0827170">
				<p>"This is how they survive. You must know this. You're too smart <em>not</em> to know this. They paint the world full of shadows and then tell their children to stay close to the light. Their light, their reason, their judgements, because in the darkness there be dragons. But it isnâ€™t true. We can prove that it isnâ€™t true. In the dark, there is discovery, there is possibility, there is freedom in the dark..."</p>

			<h3>Stickers near the keyboard</h3>
			<p>Once opened, there is one sticker near the keyboard area.  It is of a black cat inside of a fencing mask.  The cat appears to be sleeping.</p>
